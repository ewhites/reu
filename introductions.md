# Mentor/Mentee Introduction Assignment

### Question 1: Why do you want to do research?

I'd like to do research so that I can understand the basic methodologys used in cosmic ray physics, so that I can make sure 100% that I want to pursue it in graduate school. I also really love the concept of UHECR physics (hadronic showers and extreme energies and all that).

### Question 2: What are your career goals? How can this research experience and the mentor–trainee relationship help you achieve them?

I'm planning on going onwards to graduate school, probably within particle astrophysics (cosmic rays/neutrinos specifically). This research experience/relationship can help a ton by gaining me relevant experience and it will sort of be a dip of my toes into the field such that I can learn about what research within it is actually like. I think the mentor relationship can help a ton with connecting me with relevant researchers that Dr. Matthews/Dr. Kim thinks I may work well with / could become friends with.

### Question 3: What would success in this research experience look like to you?

Success, in this experience, would look like:
1. Understanding basic data analysis techniques used in cosmic ray physics.
2. Complete a project with satisfying results, or replicating some sort of measurement through my own analysis or something
3. Getting results I am proud of / creating a good poster + 10 minute presentation off of it.
4. Making the most of my time in Utah (exploring the surrounding nature areas, exploring the city, trying new things)

### Question 4: How many hours per week and at what times/days do you expect to work on your mentor’s research?

I'm very flexible. I'd like to work 35-40 hours per week, but if my work requires more then I am willing to spend 50 hours/week to get the results I need. 

For times/days, I think 8:00 - 4:00 PM every weekday would work best for me. Mondays maybe 9:00 - 5:00 PM.

### Question 5: Assuming a good fit, how long do you expect to work with this research group?

I think it'd be awesome to work later into the fall/winter/spring, and, depending on my graduate school admission process and if I work exceptionally well with the group, maybe going to graduate school at the U!

### Question 6: What, if any, specific technical or communication skills do you expect to learn as part of the research experience?

I have no specific technical/communication skills I expect to learn. I'd really love to make a good poster and presentation out of it though.

### Question 7: How do you learn best (written procedure, verbal instructions, watch and repeat, etc.)? What can your mentor do to help you learn the techniques and skills in a timely manner that you need to be successful in your research lab? What can you do before you start in the lab to allow you to be successful in this research group?

I learn best through watch and repeat for hardware things and written procedure for software/analysis things. I often have questions about procedure/what I need to do, so keeping an open line of communication with my mentor is pretty important to me. I've read through the relevant thesis/presentation Dr. Matthews recommended so I feel kind of prepared (I know sort of how TA works).

### Question 8: Once you are trained in basic techniques, would you prefer to continue to work closely with others (e.g., on a team project), or independently?

I think I would prefer to work independently, but I'd like to physically be in the area of others so that I can ask them questions if needed.

### Question 9: Once you have learned the techniques and procedures used in your lab do you prefer that your mentor watch closely what you do, walking your through all the steps, or do you prefer a hands off approach to being supervised?

I prefer sort of a middle ground here. I don't need to be watched super closely/walked through every step, but I would strongly appreciate if I were able to ask questions and receive feedback in a timely manner.

### Question 10: How will you document your research results? Is there a specific protocol for keeping a laboratory notebook in your research group?

I'm perfectly fine with using my personal GitHub account to document my research results. Or Google Docs, or some sort of Microsoft notebook (this is what I used last summer).

### Question 11: To whom do you expect to go if you have questions about your research project? Does your mentor expect you to come solely (or first) to them, or should you feel free to ask others in the research group? If others, can your mentor identify those in the group who would be good resource people for your project?

I'm fine with either going to Dr. Kim or Dr. Matthews first, but I will probably go to Dr. Kim first. I'm not sure who the others are in the group that will be working on the project.

### Question 12: Are you comfortable with the methodology used in the lab? Does it involve the use of animals, for example? Does it involve lengthy field trips where you might be isolated with other researchers for weeks at a time? How do you feel about that?

Since I may be doing some hardware stuff, and since TA is in Delta, I'm perfectly fine with traveling down there. I have a car already and I absolutely love camping, so I'd be fine with overnight stays in the area if needed.

### Question 13: Will the research that you will be involved in be confidential? Are you allowed to discuss your project with other individuals outside of your laboratory?

I'm not sure how to answer this since I have no authority here.

### Question 14: What role will your mentor play in the development of your skills as a writer? Is your mentor willing to help you with your research-related writing along the way or does he/she only want to read it after it is in its final version? If your mentor only wants to read final versions of your writing, could they appoint someone in the laboratory/research team to proofread your writings?

I'm not sure how to answer this since I have no authority here.

### Question 15: Do you know all the institutional safety and ethics training that is required to work in your research project? Discuss the required training with your mentor and establish a deadline by which you should complete it.

Not sure how to answer this again.

### Question 16: If you have previous research experience, what skills do you expect to bring to your new research group?

I'm familiar with C++/ROOT and Python. I have previous research experience with photomultiplier tubes (the gain-matching process) and I think I understand them mechanically pretty well. I have previous experience with vacuum systems for beams, I know how to solder, and I know some basic stuff about wiring/creating/modifying wires. I have a rough understanding of how DAQs work.
