# Mentor/Mentee Introductions


### Question 1: Why do you want to do research?

### Question 2: What are your career goals? How can this research experience and the mentor–trainee relationship help you achieve them?

### Question 3: What would success in this research experience look like to you?

### Question 4: How many hours per week and at what times/days do you expect to work on your mentor’s research?

### Question 5: Assuming a good fit, how long do you expect to work with this research group?

### Question 6: What, if any, specific technical or communication skills do you expect to learn as part of the research experience?

### Question 7: How do you learn best (written procedure, verbal instructions, watch and repeat, etc.)? What can your mentor do to help you learn the techniques and skills in a timely manner that you need to be successful in your research lab? What can you do before you start in the lab to allow you to be successful in this research group?

### Question 8: Once you are trained in basic techniques, would you prefer to continue to work closely with others (e.g., on a team project), or independently?

### Question 9: Once you have learned the techniques and procedures used in your lab do you prefer that your mentor watch closely what you do, walking your through all the steps, or do you prefer a hands off approach to being supervised?

### Question 10: How will you document your research results? Is there a specific protocol for keeping a laboratory notebook in your research group?

### Question 11: To whom do you expect to go if you have questions about your research project? Does your mentor expect you to come solely (or first) to them, or should you feel free to ask others in the research group? If others, can your mentor identify those in the group who would be good resource people for your project?

### Question 12: Are you comfortable with the methodology used in the lab? Does it involve the use of animals, for example? Does it involve lengthy field trips where you might be isolated with other researchers for weeks at a time? How do you feel about that?

### Question 13: Will the research that you will be involved in be confidential? Are you allowed to discuss your project with other individuals outside of your laboratory?

### Question 14: What role will your mentor play in the development of your skills as a writer? Is your mentor willing to help you with your research-related writing along the way or does he/she only want to read it after it is in its final version? If your mentor only wants to read final versions of your writing, could they appoint someone in the laboratory/research team to proofread your writings?

### Question 15: Do you know all the institutional safety and ethics training that is required to work in your research project? Discuss the required training with your mentor and establish a deadline by which you should complete it.

### Question 16: If you have previous research experience, what skills do you expect to bring to your new research group?
